# eCourts Cause List Scraper

## Important Note for Submission

This project was completed and submitted on the deadline, October 20th, 2025. As this date coincides with the Diwali public holiday, the New Delhi District Court did not publish a cause list.

The application is fully functional and correctly reports that no files are available on the website for this reason. The accompanying video demonstrates this behavior. A new video showing a successful download can be provided on the next working day (October 21st) if required.


This is a Python application that downloads the daily cause lists from the New Delhi District Court website.

## Setup

1.  Make sure you have Python installed.
2.  Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit selenium webdriver-manager requests beautifulsoup4
    ```

## How to Run

1.  Open a terminal in the project folder.
2.  Run the following command:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
3.  A new tab will open in your web browser with the application.
